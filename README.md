## 🛠️ Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hamzaowaisog/DeepLearning-Pytorch.git
    cd DeepLearning-Pytorch
    ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
    venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Download or prepare the necessary datasets by following the instructions in the [Data](#data) section.

## 🚀 Usage

You can run the training scripts with different configurations or models. Below is a basic example:

```bash
python train.py --model resnet18 --epochs 50 --batch-size 32 --lr 0.001
```

For detailed usage, refer to the `train.py` script or use the `--help` flag to see available options:

```bash
python train.py --help
```

### 💻 Running on GPU
If you have a CUDA-enabled GPU, the training script will automatically use it. You can manually specify the device using:

```bash
python train.py --device cuda
```

## 📂 Data

Data is essential for training deep learning models. Ensure you download or prepare your dataset before training. Place the dataset in the appropriate folder as per the project structure, or specify the path in the command.

You can use the provided [data download script](download_data.py) to download datasets automatically:

```bash
python download_data.py
```

## 🧠 Models

This project includes implementations for several models such as:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- ResNet, VGG, etc.

You can choose different models by passing the `--model` argument to the training script.

## 📊 Results

Evaluation results, including accuracy and loss plots, are stored in the `results/` directory after training. Visualizations of model performance (like loss curves) are also available.
